The next step is for you to use the data and do the following tasks:

1. Data preparation process
2. Create basic analytics on the nature of the data
3. Providing advanced analytics such as forecast, geoanalysis, outlier, RFM or clustering
4. Generate a model which can be applied to the data based on analytics above (plus value)
5. Documenting all the process and analytics result
6. Submissions must be in reproducible codes in GitHub/GitLab
7. Any language can be used to build the pipeline but Python is preferable and prioritized
